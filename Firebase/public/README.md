# (DEPRECATED) public
DEPRECATED (this is for an older site for a previous initiative)The code for the website.

## Design principles
The code is maintained without funding of any sort by volunteers in their spare time. It should not be a hassle to contribute. To reduce the requirments of a contributors dev environment there is no tooling, currently no backend, no transpilation. It is only a single page application wich is build with riot.js to split the contents into components.

### Main principles: 
1. No tooling or build step required
2. No effort to support older browsers:  not even IE 11
3. Plain CSS and JavaScript
